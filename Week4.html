            Man versus bear seems to be the latest online discussion going around lately. It is truly a hot topic discussed with your friends, family and coworkers(?).
            As interesting as this topic dives deep, there is one man that pops into my mind with this question.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                The one and only man known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls" target="_blank"> Bear Grylls</a>. Also known as Mister Edward Michael "Bear" Grylls OBE. 
            </p>
            <p> It is difficuly to forget the name Bear Gylls, yet he is slowly fading into obscurity with younger gerenations not having seen wild moments such as the moment he drank his own urine for survival or drinking elephant poo. (As iconic as those moments were in creating a buzz in secondary school, I would not re-watch such scenes.) </p>
            <blockquote>
                I think all the shows we watched during our younger years will never compare to the content exposed to younger generations these days
            <cite>example: Skibidi toilet versus all of Bear Gryll's Man vs Wild </cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                To be quite honest, I wrote this article so that everyone within my generation will fondly remember all the wild tv shows airing in our youth.
